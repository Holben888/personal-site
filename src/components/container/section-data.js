            Iâ€™m a junior <b>Georgia Tech</b> student born and raised in
            Charleston, SC, making my way to the big city of Atlanta to pursue
            my love of CS. I dove hard into the hacking culture the second I
            arrived, entering hackathons and soaking up tech podcasts + blogs to
            learn every aspect of web development I could. The more I learned,
            the more my focus landed on the <b>frontend</b>; there's always been
            something so awesome and rewarding to me about pushing around
            graphics on a screen. It started with game development in{' '}

            adapted this GUI passion to a new medium: building websites. Now, I
            use blog posts, Twitter, and clubs as outlets to shout my web dev
            obsession from the rooftops!

            on a real world codebase as a project team member. My novice coding

            functions with <b>AngularJS</b>. By the third summer, I completed
